\description{
Check that all time periods match for multi-file ensembles. Before starting to
process what may be hundreds or thousands of CMIP5 files, it's a good idea to verify
that your file set is complete and not missing any years.
}
\details{
Decimal time is (year + (month-1)/12).
Note that this only works for files that are in domains 'fx', '*mon', or '*yr'.
