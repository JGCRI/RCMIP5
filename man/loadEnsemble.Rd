\description{
Loads the data for a particular CMIP5 experiment/variable/model/ensemble
combination (one or more files). Returns NULL and a warning if nothing matches.
}
\details{
This function is the core of RCMIP5's data-loading. It loads all files matching
the experiment, variable, model, ensemble, and perhaps domain supplied by the caller.
We can also load from the package datasets by specifying DEMO=TRUE.
