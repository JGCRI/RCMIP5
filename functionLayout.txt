This document specifies the desired functions and specifications for the project.
Started: 10 June 2014

========================================================

Overall:
	- Flexible, robust code to read, summarize, and regrid CMIP5 data.

========================================================

Input files:
- netCDF file downloaded from CMIP5 repository
	+ deal with arbitrary file structures: list.files( ..., recursive=TRUE )

Main outputs of interest:
- Zonal (including global) total/means/sd
	+ annual
	+ monthly
	+ reported time step
- Gridded temporal mean/totals/sd
	+ annual
	+ monthly
	+ reported time step

Visualizations:			**BBL: necessary?
- Global map
- Zonal total/means

Internal data representation options:
- list(time, lon, lat, area, val, sd(?)) where val is a 3D array
   **KTB: I think this is the most straightforward
   **BBL: A list? So in this implementation, how's 'val' represented? 
   
- data.frame(time, lat, lon, val)
	***BBL: possibly, esp. if we use dplyr package
	
- raster object
   **KTB: This has built in bilinear projection function that might be useful
   (though not an area-weighted projection which we would need for
   large grid shifts)

Support for/use of parallelization?
	- e.g. using 'parallel' package (R >2.14.0)
	- use dplyr? Extremely fast for data frames
	
Output options:
- Probably want a simple data frame option for less-experienced users
- ?


========================================================

Basic function tasks:
- List all downloaded files
- Load specific experiment, model, ensemble, variable
	+ filter values based on absolute and/or relative tolerances
- Merge ensembles (mean, sd)
	+ e.g. historical and RCP
- Shift grid projection
	+ area weighted
	+ bilinear interpolation
- Shift units(?)   **BBL maybe yes, we have existing code for this
- Generate annual mean
- Generate zonal (including global) total/mean/sd
- Generate multi-year seasonal cycles
- Aggregate mean/total on a spatial mask
- Generate mean/sd/min/max across all specified models
