This document specifies the desired functions and specifications for the project.
Started: 10 June 2014


Input files:
-netcdf file downloaded from CMIP5 repository
  +deal with multiple file structures
    -single directory
    -one directory for each model/variable or nested structure

Main outputs of interest:
-global total/means
  +annual
  +monthly
  +reported time step
-gridded temporal mean/totals
  +annual
  +monthly
  +reported time step

Visualizations:
-Global map
-Zonal total/means

Internal data representation options:
-list(time, lon, lat, area, val, sd(?)) where val is a 3D array
   **KTB: I think this is the most streight forward
-data.frame(time, lat, lon, val)
-raster object
   **KTB: This has built in bilinear projection function that might be useful
   (though not an area-weighted projection which we would need for
   large grid shifts)

========================================================
Basic function tasks:
-list all downloaded files
-load specific experiment, model, ensemble, variable
   +filter values based on absolute and/or relative tolerances
-merge ensemebles (mean, sd)
-shift grid projection
   +area weighted
   +bilinear intrerpolation
-shift units(?)
-generate annual mean
-generate global total/mean
-generate multi-year seasonal cycles
-aggregate mean/total on a spatial mask
