Package: RCMIP5
Title: Tools for Manipulating and Summarizing CMIP5 Data
Description: Working with CMIP5 data can be tricky, forcing scientists to write
    custom scripts and programs. The `RCMIP5` package aims to ease this
    process, providing a standard, robust, and high-performance set of scripts
    to (i) explore what data have been downloaded, (ii) identify missing data,
    (iii) average (or apply other mathematical operations) across experimental
    ensembles, (iv) produce both temporal and spatial statistical summaries,
    and (v) produce easy-to-work-with graphical and data summaries.
