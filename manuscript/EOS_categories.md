# Categories of Contributions


Eos editors will consider for publication the following types of contributions:

**Project Updates** (formerly Brief Reports) offer updates or status reports on programs, projects, or research experiments. Suitable subjects for project updates include the significance of new major scientific programs or projects, recent geophysical phenomena, longer historical notes, vignettes of key Earth and space scientists, or discussions of applications of useful new software or publicly available data collections.

Again, Eos does not publish original research results. Authorship is limited to those who actually write the manuscript and should not include those whose role was solely that as a participant in the project, program, or research. “Project teams” cannot be listed as authors.

Maximum length: 1500 word equivalents. Must have a least one image or figure, especially one that will entice readers to the project update.
