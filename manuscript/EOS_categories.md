# Categories of Contributions


Eos editors will consider for publication the following types of contributions:

**Feature Articles** offer readers in all geophysical disciplines a solid overview of a defined topic. Much like a white paper, a good feature article places its topic in a broad context; describes the work in a way that geophysicists across all disciplines can understand and appreciate the work; acknowledges the breadth of findings; and gives readers a sense of the history, challenges, and opportunities related to the topic discussed. (Think of writing it as if you were describing your work over a nice dinner with a colleague who is not in your field — someone who's smart and interested in the topic, but would likely not know a lot about the context.) A feature article does not focus on a single program, project, meeting, or research experiment. Rather, it uses several case studies or examples to describe the topic. Some articles may be tutorial in nature. All features must be broad enough to be of interest to individuals in more than one sphere of scientific interest.

The introductory paragraphs should provide a framework for all readers. In doing so, these paragraphs should address why the topic is important (even though it may seem self-evident). In particular, the first paragraph should entice all readers to continue reading. Unlike typical research articles, which build to the conclusion, a well-written item in Eos begins with the conclusions and provides details later. Specialists and nonspecialists alike should not need to read to the end to discover what is new, interesting, and important. Whenever possible, the article weaves together science and policy issues related to the topic and acknowledges alternate findings. The writing style should be brisk and readable.

The concluding section addresses what has been learned and how it can be applied as well as potential future directions. Scientific controversies and cutting-edge challenges are of special interest as potential feature articles, and we encourage authors to discuss the policy implications of their research. Opinions and calls for action are Forum pieces. A feature article, as with all Eos contributions, must not present unpublished data or results; Eos is not appropriate for first publication of research findings.

Maximum length: 2500 word equivalents. Each figure or table counts as 400 words.

**Brief Reports** offer updates or status reports on programs, projects, or research experiments. Suitable subjects for brief reports include recent geophysical phenomena, the significance of new major scientific programs or projects, longer historical notes, vignettes of key Earth and space scientists, or discussions of applications of useful new software or publicly available data collections. Again, Eos does not publish original research results. Authorship is limited to those who actually write the manuscript and should not include those whose role was solely that as a participant in the project, program, or research. “Project teams” cannot be listed as authors.

Maximum length: 1500 word equivalents. Each figure or table counts as 400 words.
